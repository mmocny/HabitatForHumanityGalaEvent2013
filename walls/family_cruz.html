<h4>Our Heart is in This House</h4>

Pam and Roger Cruz became homeowners in 2003. They were elated since they were pregnant with triplets after having son Michael. As you read the Cruz’s story, know that the Cruz’s journey was possible 

<h4>Habitat: What’s your Habitat for Humanity story?</h4>

<b>Pam:</b> Roger and I were living in a small apartment with our toddler son, Michael. We were over the 

moon when we found out we were expecting again. This time it was triplets! 3 baby girls were on the 

way! We had been saving for years and years for a home but we had to use all our money to buy a van. I 

heard about Habitat and we applied. We moved in after the girls were born in 2003.

<h4>Habitat: How are the kids doing today?</h4>

<b>Pam:</b> They’re amazing. Michael is in grade 11 and has a part-time job. He wants to be a physiotherapist 

so he’s working extra hard on his math. He’s a good kid who makes good choices. Olivia, Naomi and 

Thalia are 12 and they all play rep basketball, Thalia also plays rep soccer. The girls have big plans to 

change the world. They volunteer through our church setting up beds for out of the cold and Olivia 

came home and said to me, “people are going to stay warm because we made up those beds”. They are 

<h4>Habitat: What about your neighbourhood?</h4>

<b>Pam:</b> Our home and our neighbourhood is a huge part of who we are, and who the kids are. Home 

stability is so, so important to kids. They always have a safe place to come home, and our neighbours 

watch out for them. They babysit some of the younger kids now too. Sometimes I think about where 

they would be if we were still living in the apartment complex. And it’s not good. We feel so truly 

<h4>Habitat: What did you learn from Habitat?</h4>

<b>Pam:</b> We volunteered thousands and thousands of hours. We loved it. And Roger has learned to be 

really, really handy. We finished the basement ourselves as our kids grew up. Oh, and I learned that I’m 

not a gardener. But my neighbour is amazing and not only does she give me beautiful flowers from her 

garden, but she comes and plants them too!

<h4>Habitat: What would you say to Habitat for Humanity supporters?</h4>

<b>Pam:</b> Thank you. We appreciate everything that has been given to us, and as a family we will always 

give back through our church, our school and in our community. Our heart is in this house. It’s not just a 

house to us. It never was and it never will be. Thank you.

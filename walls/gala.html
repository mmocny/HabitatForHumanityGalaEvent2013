This award recognizes an individual that has significantly impacted Habitat for
Humanity’s success over 25 years and embodies Manulife Financials brand
attributes – strong, reliable, trustworthy and forward-thinking.</p>
<p>Manulife Financial has partnered with HFHWR, though House Sponsorship, since 
2005. In total, the Manulife crew has built 16 homes with families in need. This

such a revered and philanthropic company.</p>

<h2 hb-anchor="committeechair">Address from 25th Anniversary Committee Chair</h2>
<p>
During the past year I have come to appreciate why Habitat for Humanity Waterloo Region (HFHWR) has been so successful. It’s the people who make Habitat for Humanity what it is.  From the families we partner with, to the sponsors, the staff and the volunteers, HFHWR is made up of many talented and inspiring people.

One of the reasons I agreed to lend my energy to these 25th Anniversary celebrations was because of how much I personally admired Milo Shantz, who helped bring Habitat for Humanity to Canada.  With all his many endeavours, Milo was never too busy to help other people and get involved. It has been an honour for me to take part in this significant milestone. 

I would like to congratulate and thank everyone for supporting HFHWR’s 25th Gala this evening.  Whether you’ve swung a hammer, served a lunch, spent time in our ReStore, or donated your dollars to HFHWR, you have made a positive difference in your community and in the lives of others. 

Finally, I would also like to thank the following individuals who were part of the 25th Anniversary Committee this past year: Mary Joy Aitken, Vaughn Bender, Melissa Riewald, Jim Erb, Dianne Stickney, Jim Wideman, Karen Redman and Jerry Lawlor. 


Sincerely,

Tania Benninger

<h4>HFHWR Hearts our Families</h4>

“On each table you will see a homemade wooden heart. Please take some time to finishing spelling the word “hope” by wrapping the coloured string around the finishing nails. One finished heart will be given to each family that has partnered with HFHWR over 25 years as a gift for Christmas. This memento will commemorate the families success as homeowners, and HFHWR 25th Anniversary.”

<h4>Smile for the HFHWR Camera</h4>

“Help HFHWR document this special occasion by visiting the photo wall in the Ballroom. You can dress up in Habitat gear or just wear a beautiful or handsome smile – it’s completely up to you. Have some fun and try not to be too camera shy”

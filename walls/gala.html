<h2 hb-anchor="community">Manulife Community Builder Award</h2>
<p>2013 marks Habitat for Humanity Waterloo Regions (HFHWR) 25th Anniversary.
Knowing that this achievement would not have been possible without the support of
key individuals, HFHWR has established the <b>Manulife Community Builder</b> award.
This award recognizes an individual that has significantly impacted Habitat for
Humanity’s success over 25 years and embodies Manulife Financials brand
attributes – strong, reliable, trustworthy and forward-thinking.</p>
<p>Manulife Financial has partnered with HFHWR, though House Sponsorship, since 
2005. In total, the Manulife crew has built 16 homes with families in need. This 
relationship is integral part of HFHWR’s success and we are honoured to work with 
such a revered and philanthropic company.</p>

<h2 hb-anchor="bio">Frank O'Dea Bio</h2>
<div>
<img src="assets/img/gala/frank.png" style="float:left; height: 200px;">
<div>
In his early teens, Frank O’Dea’s life went off the rails into a downward spiral. Within
a few years, he was living in 50-cent-a-night flop houses in Toronto’s bowery district
where just surviving was about all one could do in a day. 
At 23 years of age, with the courage to hope for a better life, and the spirit to forge 
ahead, Frank began the long road back. Fighting all of those obstacles that hold back
the homeless, the impoverished and the destitute, he overcame and rejoined society. 
Within a few short years, he co-founded Second Cup, which became the largest chain of gourmet 
coffees and teas in the country. Committed to giving back, because he experienced the hopeless of 
poverty first hand, Frank O’Dea has also served on various non-profit boards and either founded or 
co-founded charitable organizations that focus on poverty awareness. 
O’Dea’s story of triumph is truly inspiring and instills a sense of hope for those that face poverty on a 
day-to-day basis.

<h2 hb-anchor="committeechair">Address from 25th Anniversary Committee Chair</h2>
<p>
During the past year I have come to appreciate why Habitat for Humanity Waterloo Region (HFHWR) has been so successful. It’s the people who make Habitat for Humanity what it is.  From the families we partner with, to the sponsors, the staff and the volunteers, HFHWR is made up of many talented and inspiring people.

One of the reasons I agreed to lend my energy to these 25th Anniversary celebrations was because of how much I personally admired Milo Shantz, who helped bring Habitat for Humanity to Canada.  With all his many endeavours, Milo was never too busy to help other people and get involved. It has been an honour for me to take part in this significant milestone. 

I would like to congratulate and thank everyone for supporting HFHWR’s 25th Gala this evening.  Whether you’ve swung a hammer, served a lunch, spent time in our ReStore, or donated your dollars to HFHWR, you have made a positive difference in your community and in the lives of others. 

Finally, I would also like to thank the following individuals who were part of the 25th Anniversary Committee this past year: Mary Joy Aitken, Vaughn Bender, Melissa Riewald, Jim Erb, Dianne Stickney, Jim Wideman, Karen Redman and Jerry Lawlor. 


Sincerely,

Tania Benninger

<h4>HFHWR Hearts our Families</h4>

“On each table you will see a homemade wooden heart. Please take some time to finishing spelling the word “hope” by wrapping the coloured string around the finishing nails. One finished heart will be given to each family that has partnered with HFHWR over 25 years as a gift for Christmas. This memento will commemorate the families success as homeowners, and HFHWR 25th Anniversary.”

<h4>Smile for the HFHWR Camera</h4>

“Help HFHWR document this special occasion by visiting the photo wall in the Ballroom. You can dress up in Habitat gear or just wear a beautiful or handsome smile – it’s completely up to you. Have some fun and try not to be too camera shy”

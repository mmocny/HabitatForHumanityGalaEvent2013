<h4>It’s just all about my kids.</h4>

Terry Ann Thompson beams with pride when she talks about her new Habitat for 
Humanity home. A single mother with 5 kids – the oldest is 11 and the youngest is 3 – 
Terry Ann isn’t even the most excited about having a brand new house, a larger kitchen 
or their own back yard. She’s most excited about what you don’t see in her new home: 
her sense of accomplishment. 
 
 “I’m giving my kids something stable, a home to call ours forever. When I had my first 
child, I dreamed of one day having my own home. And now that dream has come true,” 
she continues. 
 
The kids chatter about the new house all the time. “My oldest daughter is finally going 
to get her own room. She feels so lucky.” Even the younger kids can’t wait: “We drive 
past the development on the way home from church every week. We notice all the little 
things that are changing. It’s amazing!” 
 
Terry Ann is a Personal Support Worker at Sunnyside Nursing Home, and also works 
part-time at a restaurant. She’s also now an expert at cutting drywall, thanks to her 
Sweat Equity – volunteer hours that new homeowners contribute on the Build Site. 
Terry Ann is delighted that she’s able to do work on her very own unit. “I look around 
and I think, I cut that drywall. I did that!” 
 
 Meeting other volunteers has been fantastic for Terry Ann. “I talk to all the other 
volunteers on the build site. I’m so humbled that people from all walks of life take time 
out of their days to help me build my house. It’s really an unbelievable feeling.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 She also jokes that she’s never, ever changing the paint colours. “I’m keeping it! 
Whatever is on those walls is staying – I know how hard we all are working to paint the 
house. I’m not changing it!” 
 
 Terry Ann’s energy and enthusiasm is matched only by her genuine appreciation for 
Habitat Waterloo and our supporters. “Without you, this just wouldn’t be possible. I’ll 
never, ever forget that. Thank you. So, so much.”

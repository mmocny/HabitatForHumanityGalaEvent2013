<div>
<p>
Ellie and Ken Fields and their boys were one of our first Habitat Waterloo families
(Homeowners since 1993). As you read Ellie’s story, remember that the impact of
your support for Habitat is truly amazing!

<h4>Habitat: Tell us about your neighbourhood.</h4>
<b>Ellie:</b> Our whole neighbourhood has been a big blessing. We have been really
blessed to grow up with the other families on our street, their children and now
grandchildren! We look after each other. When somebody had a new baby there
would be a shower. Or, you know, we knew we could leave our kids with each other
for short periods of time, get a little break. It’s like an old-fashioned neighbourhood.
We made it happen. We treat each other with respect. And the kids too. They’ll stop
and say “Hi, how are you Mrs. Fields”. I remember when our neighbour got his
driver’s license he hopped off the bus and sat down on the steps with me. He was
so excited.

<h4>Habitat: How did Habitat change things for you and Ken?</h4>
<b>Ellie:</b> It’s really the kids who benefit the most. The future generation. When a child
grows up feeling secure, connected to the community, that their roots are stable,
and that there is a sense of love, they grow into who they are and shoot to reach
their potential. Our oldest son, Chris is looking to buy his first home. Habitat gave us
a hand up. Our kids have shot higher than what we shot for in life.

<h4>Habitat: Is it true that Ken built a hockey rink in the neighbourhood? </h4>
<b>Ellie:</b> (laughing) Absolutely. Every year for over 20 years. First he did it for our sons,
and then with our sons for the other kids. A lot of the neighbourhood kids would
come down to the rink. And even the ones who couldn’t skate, I would take them
out on the toboggan and whip them around so they’d get a thrill too. And in summer
we use the
space as a co-op garden. We grow our own food. Tomatoes, beans and things like
that. It’s really neat to be outside and pick something and that’s what we’re having
for supper tonight!

<h4>Habitat: You talk about Habitat as “not a handout”. What do you mean?</h4>
<b>Ellie:</b> It was not a handout. It’s a hand up. We did our 500 hours of sweat equity,
and we worked hard to pay the mortgage off – we even did it ahead of schedule. It’s
not a fairytale ending. It was a hand up when we needed it and you felt like you
were just a bit of a higher level. You thought you could relate differently. You have a
respect for where people come from and helping them up along the way.

<h4>Habitat: What would you say to supporters of Habitat Waterloo?</h4>
<b>Ellie:</b> I think the best thing that would capture it is that it takes a community to raise
a family and when you give, you contribute to that community. It may leave your
pocket, but the gift is ongoing. You know, our mortgages go to building other houses
so it keeps going. If you’re volunteering, or if you’re giving money, or if you’re
giving materials, the giving goes on and on. You may give for five seconds but it
lasts lifetime. 
And I would say thank you for our home. It housed us, gave us warmth. We put
warmth into it and the only thing that counts is love. I can rest assured knowing that
we have put love into those walls, and that those walls will be able to give another
family love someday.
